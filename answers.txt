Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science empowers people to make data-informed decisions, which is something applicable and
potentially desirable to a wide variety of fields. One interesting use case is in language and literature,
with an example being the use of machine learning on the textual data of Shakespeare's plays to determine
where co-authorship may have occurred.
