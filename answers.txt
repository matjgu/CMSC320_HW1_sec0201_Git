Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is an extremely helpful system for version control and tracking. Some examples of situations
where it might prove especially useful include when you are collaborating with other programmers on the
same project and want to debug someone else's contribution, or even individually if you make a change to
your own code that creates new errors and want to go back to a previous version.
