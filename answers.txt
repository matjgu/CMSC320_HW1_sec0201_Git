Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is an extremely helpful system for version control and tracking. Some examples of situations
where it might prove especially useful include when you are collaborating with other programmers on the
same project and want to debug someone else's contribution, or even individually if you make a change to
your own code that creates new errors and want to go back to a previous version.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science empowers people to make data-informed decisions, which is something applicable and
potentially desirable to a wide variety of fields. One interesting use case is in language and literature,
with an example being the use of machine learning on the textual data of Shakespeare's plays to determine
where co-authorship may have occurred.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging leaves the history of individual branches and their merging intact, while rebasing 
directly manipulates the project history by essentially moving a branch atop of another.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to doing things that I like and undergoing character development 
by surviving the things that I don't like (hopefully).
